CLI-first MCP server for Composer-based Kirby CMS projects. It lets an IDE or agent inspect your Kirby project (blueprints, templates, plugins, docs) and interact with a real Kirby runtime. It ships with a local knowledge base of Kirby concepts and tasks. For agent-specific install steps (Claude Code, Codex CLI) and Skill sync, see **Client setup**.

It can also run as a projectless global reference MCP (`kirby-mcp --global`) for always-on Kirby docs/KB research. Global reference mode is intentionally separate from project-local MCP servers and cannot inspect, render, update, or run commands in a Kirby project.

The server uses MCP SDK v0.8 dual-era dispatch: existing clients negotiate stateful sessions through `initialize`, while `2026-07-28` clients use stateless requests. MCP logging requests are not advertised—diagnostics are written to stderr instead. A valid W3C v00 `traceparent` supplied by a modern request, including the native HTTP header from browser clients, is included for correlation; `tracestate` and `baggage` are never logged.

> [!WARNING]
> Prompt injection is a serious security threat, especially when used with documents retrieved from the internet. You might not see it happen when observing the conversation with the agent!

## Quickstart

From your Kirby project root:

```bash
composer require bnomei/kirby-mcp --dev
vendor/bin/kirby-mcp install
vendor/bin/kirby-mcp
```

This quickstart is for a local stdio MCP server. If you want Kirby to serve a production HTTP
`/mcp` route, install `bnomei/kirby-mcp` as a normal Composer dependency instead of `--dev`; see
**HTTP transport** below.

Then configure your MCP client (Cursor/Claude Code/Codex CLI) using the examples in **Client setup** and copy the bundled Skills as described below.

See **Client setup → Claude Code** and **Client setup → Codex CLI** for per-agent install and Skill sync steps.

## Global Reference Mode

Install once with Composer and run the global reference MCP anywhere:

```bash
composer global require bnomei/kirby-mcp
kirby-mcp --global
```

Use this mode for always-available Kirby research: bundled KB search, glossary, Panel field/section reference, hooks, extensions, update-schema guides, official docs search, and plugin directory search.

Global reference mode is projectless by design:

- It does not auto-detect or accept `--project`.
- It does not expose project/runtime tools such as `kirby_roots`, `kirby_info`, `kirby_render_page`, content updates, eval/query, runtime install, or IDE helper generation.
- If you need project context or mutations, add a separate project-local MCP server with `vendor/bin/kirby-mcp`.

## Copy-paste request examples

Use these once your MCP client is connected to the server.

### Planning & content

> [!TIP]
> "Use the Kirby MCP to make a plan to..." is a reliable way to get your agent to use the tools and resources this MCP server provides. If you ask it to take action, it tends to edit files directly based on its training and skills.

```text
Use the Kirby MCP to make a plan to... build a contact form page.
```

`kirby_roots`, `kirby_blueprint_read`, `kirby_templates_index`, `kirby_snippets_index`, `kirby_controllers_index`, `kirby_render_page`, `kirby_dump_log_tail`, `kirby://config/{option}`

<details>
<summary>Agent response example:</summary>

```text
Here’s a Kirby MCP–driven plan for a new contact form page in this project:

- Confirm requirements: fields (name/email/message), spam protection (honeypot + csrf()), success UX (inline vs redirect), and whether to store submissions.
- Panel setup: reuse existing blueprint site/blueprints/pages/contact.yml; update site/blueprints/site.yml so the site “pages” section allows creating template contact.
- Create the page: add content/4_contact/contact.txt (or create via Panel once allowed) and fill recipient, subject, success, text.
- Frontend: add site/templates/contact.php + a snippet like site/snippets/contact-form.php (escape all echoed user input; include hidden CSRF field + honeypot).
- Controller: add site/controllers/contact.php to handle POST: check csrf(get('csrf')), validate with invalid(), then send mail via $kirby->email() using replyTo (never use user input as from) and an email template like site/templates/emails/contact.text.php (optional contact.html.php).
- Email config: add site/config/config.php email.transport/email.presets (current kirby://config/email is null).
- Verify with MCP: render the page via kirby_render_page(id='contact', noCache=true); debug with mcp_dump() + kirby_dump_log_tail(traceId=...); inspect blueprint/roots via kirby_blueprint_read(id='pages/contact') and kirby://roots.
```

---

```text
Show me the fields available on the home page blueprint and what they do using the MCP.
```

`kirby_blueprint_read`, `kirby_blueprints_index`

---

```text
Show me the current content of the about page.
```

`kirby_read_page_content`

---

```text
Append " with AI" to the title of the home page with Kirby MCP.
```

`kirby_read_page_content`, `kirby_update_page_content`, `kirby://field/text/update-schema`

### Resource shortcuts

> [!TIP]
> Either on its own or with a request, the resources can be used to quickly bring knowledge and runtime information into the current context of your agent.

```text
kirby://glossary/collection
```

`kirby://glossary/{term}`

---

```text
What is the kirby://config/debug for production?
```

`kirby://config/{option}`

### Search & docs

> [!TIP]
> The MCP server ships with a local knowledge base about Kirby. It consists of a glossary, common tasks, and update guides for content fields. This reduces the need to rely on external resources and is very fast.

```text
kirby search for collection filtering
```

`kirby_search`

---

> [!TIP]
> But sometimes you or your agent needs to dig deeper. That is why the MCP server also provides a fallback to the official Kirby search and docs (not including the forum). You can trigger it by mentioning `search online` in your request.

```text
kirby search online for panel permissions
```

`kirby_online`

---

> [!TIP]
> When you need to discover third-party plugins, you can also search the official Kirby plugin directory and fetch details from each plugin page.

```text
kirby search plugins online for e-commerce cart
```

`kirby_online_plugins`

---

> [!TIP]
> Your agent will use the next tool under the hood itself, but you can use it as well to quickly check what the MCP server knows about a given topic.

```text
What mcp tool should I use to... list plugins?
```

`kirby_tool_suggest`

### Inventory (runtime + filesystem)

```text
list blueprints, templates, snippets, collections, controllers, models, plugins, routes, roots
```

`kirby_blueprints_loaded`, `kirby_blueprints_index`, `kirby_templates_index`, `kirby_snippets_index`, `kirby_collections_index`, `kirby_controllers_index`, `kirby_models_index`, `kirby_plugins_index`, `kirby_routes_index`, `kirby_roots`

### Debug, tinker/eval and running commands

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The `kirby_eval` tool is disabled by default and CLI commands are protected by an allowlist/denylist, see config and security below.

```text
kirby MCP tinker $site->index()->count()
```

`kirby_eval`

---

```text
kirby MCP check query site.find('notes').unlisted.count
kirby MCP check query page.siblings.count (model: notes)
```

`kirby_query_dot`

---

```text
run kirby cli command uuid:populate
```

`kirby_run_cli_command`

```

`kirby_render_page`, `kirby_dump_log_tail`, `kirby_templates_index`, `kirby_snippets_index`, `kirby_controllers_index`, `kirby_models_index`

## Capabilities

> [!INFO]
> `kirby_init` is required once per handshake session before other tools. It remains available as optional audit/guidance for stateless `2026-07-28` calls. Some capabilities require runtime wrappers because they query Kirby at runtime.

At initialization, the server tells the agent which tools/resources to use. The knowledge base cross-references them so the agent can find the next step.

Current inventory: 37 tools, 15 resources, 15 resource templates, 216 KB articles.

In global reference mode (`kirby-mcp --global`), the exposed surface is intentionally smaller: `kirby_init`, `kirby_search`, `kirby_online`, `kirby_online_plugins`, `kirby_tool_suggest`, and static reference resources/templates (`kirby://kb`, glossary, fields/sections, hooks, extensions, and update schemas).

Modern `2026-07-28` clients receive one-hour public cache hints for the global reference profile's deployment-static discovery surface and for bundled KB/reference index reads in either profile. Externally fetched docs and all project-specific results remain private and immediately stale.
Tool results that expose concrete `kirby://` references in structured fields also include navigable resource links for modern clients; URI templates remain structured references only.

- `kirby_update_user_content` — update user content, plus confirm (see `kirby://blueprint/user/update-schema` + `kirby://field/{type}/update-schema` for payload shapes)

Update tool `data` input accepts either a JSON object or a JSON-encoded object string for backward compatibility.
If your client supports MCP resource subscriptions, successful `kirby_update_*_content` writes emit `notifications/resources/updated` for subscribed content resources (`kirby://site/content`, `kirby://page/content/{...}`, `kirby://file/content/{...}`, `kirby://user/content/{...}`).
Confirm-gated tools (`kirby_update_*_content`, `kirby_eval`, `kirby_query_dot`) keep explicit `confirm=true`; clients with MCP elicitation support may present an inline confirmation prompt and continue on accept. Modern confirmations are bound to the complete operation inputs. If a retry changes those inputs, the stale response is ignored and the tool returns a safe preview with `confirmationStatus: "stale_input_ignored"` and `retryWithoutInputResponses: true`; start a fresh call to confirm the changed operation.

## Client setup

> [!NOTE]
> The `--project` flag is optional when you run the server from the Kirby project root.
> Use it (or `KIRBY_MCP_PROJECT_ROOT`) only for project-local MCP servers that should inspect a specific Kirby project.
> Command-based stdio is the default and recommended setup for local IDE/agent use.
> `kirby-mcp --global` is a separate projectless reference server and must not be combined with `--project`.

### Cursor

Add to `.cursor/mcp.json` (project) or `~/.cursor/mcp.json` (global):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "kirby-reference": {
      "command": "kirby-mcp",
      "args": ["--global"]
    },
    "kirby-project": {
      "command": "/absolute/path/to/kirby-project/vendor/bin/kirby-mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

Use `kirby-reference` for docs/KB research that is always available. Use `kirby-project` only when that specific Kirby project should be inspectable or mutable.

### Claude Code

From the Kirby project directory:

```bash
claude mcp add kirby -- vendor/bin/kirby-mcp
```

Global reference server:

```bash
claude mcp add kirby-reference -- kirby-mcp --global
```

Or explicitly:

```bash
claude mcp add kirby -- vendor/bin/kirby-mcp --project=/absolute/path/to/kirby-project
```

Copy bundled Skills (personal scope):

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills
rsync -a vendor/bnomei/kirby-mcp/skills/ ~/.claude/skills/
```

Restart Claude Code after copying (use `.claude/skills/` instead for repo-scoped skills).

### Codex CLI

From the Kirby project directory:

```bash
codex mcp add kirby -- vendor/bin/kirby-mcp
```

Global reference server:

```bash
codex mcp add kirby-reference -- kirby-mcp --global
```

Or explicitly:

```bash
codex mcp add kirby -- vendor/bin/kirby-mcp --project=/absolute/path/to/kirby-project
```

Copy bundled Skills (user scope):

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.codex/skills
rsync -a vendor/bnomei/kirby-mcp/skills/ ~/.codex/skills/
```

Restart Codex CLI after copying.

### Manual

Start the server (point it at a composer-based Kirby project):

- From the Kirby project root: `vendor/bin/kirby-mcp`
- Or explicitly: `vendor/bin/kirby-mcp --project=/absolute/path/to/kirby-project`
- Or as the projectless global reference server: `kirby-mcp --global`

### HTTP transport (optional)

HTTP is disabled by default. `vendor/bin/kirby-mcp` continues to run stdio unless you add the Kirby
route and set `"http.enabled": true` in `.kirby-mcp/mcp.json` or environment variables.

Modern resource update subscriptions use a bounded, 120-second local-filesystem bus under `.kirby-mcp/http-notifications` so separate same-host HTTP workers can communicate. Each subscribed URI requires the same bearer scope as reading that resource; project content subscriptions require `kirby-mcp:runtime`. This is not multi-host/NFS storage and does not promise durability or exactly-once delivery. Stateless dump calls must pass an explicit render `traceId` or request `path`; only handshake sessions provide last-trace convenience. Confirmation elicitation is a user-safety interaction, while HTTP bearer scopes are authorization; explicit `confirm=true` remains supported.

> [!NOTE]
> Remote HTTP follows the standard MCP pattern: HTTPS `/mcp`, Bearer/OAuth auth, and MCP metadata
> discovery. Claude Code and Claude Desktop/Claude.ai custom connectors are the primary tested
> targets. Other MCP-compatible clients may work if they support remote HTTP MCP and the configured
> auth mode. OpenAI/ChatGPT uses MCP through Responses API tools and ChatGPT Apps/MCP Apps, not the
> Claude custom-connector URL flow documented here.

Use one auth mode:

| Mode           | Use for                                                      |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `shared-token` | Local loopback development with a client on the same host.   |
| `remote-token` | Public HTTPS routes for clients that can send Bearer tokens. |
| `oauth`        | Claude Desktop/Claude.ai custom connectors or OAuth clients. |

For a Kirby route, install this package as a production dependency:

```bash
composer require bnomei/kirby-mcp
```

Do not install it with `composer require --dev` if your `/mcp` route should work in production;
the production PHP runtime must be able to autoload `Bnomei\KirbyMcp\Mcp\KirbyMcpRoutes`.

Add these routes to your Kirby config, usually `site/config/config.php`:

```php
<?php

use Bnomei\KirbyMcp\Mcp\KirbyMcpRoutes;

return [
    'routes' => [
        ...KirbyMcpRoutes::routes(),
    ],
];
```

If your config already defines `routes`, spread these entries into the existing routes array
instead of replacing it. No special Nginx location or `vendor/bin/kirby-mcp` proxy is required.

The route helper adds `/mcp` plus the optional OAuth metadata, registration, authorize/token, JWKS,
and login routes. If you change `http.path`, pass the same path to the route helper:

```php
'routes' => [
    ...KirbyMcpRoutes::routes('/custom-mcp'),
],
```

If you also change the built-in OAuth provider path, pass it as a named argument:

```php
'routes' => [
    ...KirbyMcpRoutes::routes('/custom-mcp', oauthPath: '/custom-mcp/oauth'),
],
```

Put the JSON examples below in your Kirby project’s MCP config file:`.kirby-mcp/mcp.json`.

> [!WARNING]
> All `/mcp` requests require `Authorization: Bearer ...`; query-string credentials are rejected.
> Public route requests require HTTPS, requests with an `Origin` header must match
> `http.allowedOrigins`, and every operation is scope-checked. If the route is registered but
> `http.enabled` is false, it returns 404.

#### Local loopback token

Use `shared-token` only for local development from the same machine:

```json
{
  "http": {
    "enabled": true,
    "path": "/mcp",
    "allowedOrigins": ["http://127.0.0.1:3000"],
    "auth": {
      "mode": "shared-token",
      "token": "replace-with-a-long-random-secret",
      "scopes": ["kirby-mcp:read", "kirby-mcp:runtime", "kirby-mcp:write", "kirby-mcp:execute", "kirby-mcp:admin"]
    }
  }
}
```

The Kirby route rejects shared-token requests unless PHP reports `REMOTE_ADDR` as loopback and the request host is a real loopback host (`localhost`, `::1`, or a valid IPv4 literal in `127.0.0.0/8`).

#### Remote bearer token (recommended)

Use `remote-token` for public HTTPS routes when the client can send a static Bearer token:

```json
{
  "http": {
    "enabled": true,
    "path": "/mcp",
    "allowedOrigins": [],
    "auth": {
      "mode": "remote-token",
      "tokens": [
        {
          "id": "claude-code",
          "hash": "sha256:replace-with-sha256-token-hash",
          "scopes": ["kirby-mcp:read", "kirby-mcp:runtime", "kirby-mcp:write", "kirby-mcp:execute", "kirby-mcp:admin"]
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Local CLI clients usually send no `Origin` header, so omit `allowedOrigins` or leave it empty. Add
exact origins only for browser or webview clients that send `Origin`, for example
`http://localhost:5173`.

Generate the token hash:

```bash
php -r 'echo "sha256:" . hash("sha256", $argv[1]) . PHP_EOL;' 'replace-with-a-long-random-secret'
```

Or provide the raw token through the environment:

```bash
KIRBY_MCP_HTTP_AUTH_MODE=remote-token
KIRBY_MCP_HTTP_REMOTE_TOKEN=replace-with-a-long-random-secret
KIRBY_MCP_HTTP_REMOTE_TOKEN_ID=claude-code
KIRBY_MCP_HTTP_REMOTE_TOKEN_SCOPES=kirby-mcp:read,kirby-mcp:runtime
```

Use OAuth instead for Claude Desktop/Claude.ai custom connectors.

#### OAuth auth (for Claude Desktop/Ai)

Use `oauth` for Claude Desktop/Claude.ai custom connectors. No separate OAuth server package is
required for the built-in Claude flow.

1. Register `KirbyMcpRoutes::routes()`.
2. Enable the config below.
3. Add a Claude custom connector with MCP server URL `https://example.com/mcp`.
4. Add the consent snippet only if you want a custom approval screen.

```json
{
  "http": {
    "enabled": true,
    "path": "/mcp",
    "allowedOrigins": ["https://claude.ai"],
    "auth": {
      "mode": "oauth",
      "scopes": ["kirby-mcp:read", "kirby-mcp:runtime", "kirby-mcp:write", "kirby-mcp:execute", "kirby-mcp:admin"]
    },
    "oauthProvider": {

```

With `oauthProvider.enabled=true`, the route derives issuer, audience/resource, and JWKS URL from
the incoming HTTPS request unless you set `http.auth.issuer`, `http.auth.audience`, or
`http.auth.jwksUri`. Provider state is stored under `.kirby-mcp/oauth`, not in Kirby cache.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Consent defaults to `snippet`. A logged-in Kirby user must approve or deny the client before Claude
> gets a token. If the user is not logged in, Kirby MCP stores the authorize request under
> `.kirby-mcp/oauth/sessions`, redirects through `/mcp/oauth/login`, and resumes the OAuth flow
> after login. Use `auto` only for trusted private deployments.

For a custom approval screen, create a new snippet. The default snippet name is `kirby-mcp/oauth-consent`, which maps to `site/snippets/kirby-mcp/oauth-consent.php` in a Kirby project. The snippet receives `client`, `scopes`, `user`, `approveUrl`, `denyUrl`, and `error`:

```php
<?php
$clientName = (string) ($client['client_name'] ?? $client['client_id'] ?? 'OAuth client');
$userEmail = (string) ($user?->email() ?? 'Kirby user');
?>

<?php if ($error !== null): ?>
<p><?= esc((string) $error) ?></p>
<?php endif ?>

<form method="post" action="<?= esc((string) $approveUrl, 'attr') ?>">
  <h1>Authorize <?= esc($clientName) ?></h1>
  <p><?= esc($userEmail) ?></p>
  <ul>
    <?php foreach ($scopes as $scope): ?>
    <li><?= esc((string) $scope) ?></li>
    <?php endforeach ?>
  </ul>
  <input type="hidden" name="csrf" value="<?= esc((string) csrf(), 'attr') ?>">
  <button type="submit" name="approve" value="1">Approve</button>
  <button type="submit" name="deny" value="1" formaction="<?= esc((string) $denyUrl, 'attr') ?>">Deny</button>
</form>
```

The snippet must submit `POST` back to the provided authorize URL, include a `csrf` field generated
by Kirby's `csrf()` helper, and submit either `approve=1` or `deny=1`.

##### Custom OAuth/OIDC issuer

If you already have, or want to build, a separate OAuth/OIDC authorization server, keep
`oauthProvider.enabled` false and configure the issuer, audience/resource, and JWKS URI yourself:

```json
{
  "http": {
    "enabled": true,
    "path": "/mcp",
    "allowedOrigins": ["https://client.example"],
    "auth": {
      "mode": "oauth",
      "issuer": "https://auth.example.test",
      "audience": "https://example.test/mcp",
      "jwksUri": "https://auth.example.test/.well-known/jwks.json",
      "scopes": ["kirby-mcp:read", "kirby-mcp:runtime", "kirby-mcp:write", "kirby-mcp:execute", "kirby-mcp:admin"]
    }
  }
}
```

OAuth mode validates JWT access tokens by issuer, audience/resource, JWKS signature, expiry, and
operation scopes. Kirby MCP validates the resulting JWTs for this mode; it does not run your custom
authorization server for you. A package such as `league/oauth2-server` can be useful if you build
that issuer yourself, but it is not used by the built-in Claude OAuth provider.

HTTP tokens are scope-checked per operation. Available scope names are:

- `kirby-mcp:read` for read-only tools and resources.
- `kirby-mcp:runtime` for runtime inspection that executes Kirby CLI wrappers.
- `kirby-mcp:write` for content/file/user/site mutations, still requiring confirmation.
- `kirby-mcp:execute` for query/eval-style operations, still requiring enablement and confirmation.
- `kirby-mcp:admin` for administrative runtime actions.

Composer installs the HTTP/JWT runtime libraries needed by Kirby MCP itself as direct package
dependencies; upgrading this package is enough for consumers unless your deployment pins Composer
with `--no-update`.

## IDE helpers (optional, for humans)

The agent can both check and generate IDE helpers for your project: `kirby_ide_helpers_status` and `kirby_generate_ide_helpers`. You can also use the CLI commands yourself.

- Check baseline + freshness: `vendor/bin/kirby-mcp ide:status` (use `--details` and `--limit=N` for more output)
- Generate regeneratable helper files: `vendor/bin/kirby-mcp ide:generate` (default is `--dry-run`; add `--write` to create files)
- JSON output: `--json` (MCP markers) or `--raw-json` (plain JSON)

## What the MCP server does (and doesn’t)

- Provides MCP tools/resources for project inspection (blueprints, templates/snippets/collections, controllers/models, plugins, routes, roots).
- Fetches official Kirby reference docs and ships a local Markdown knowledge base (`kb/`) for fast lookups.
- Doesn’t modify your content by default; write-capable actions run by the MCP are guarded and require explicit opt-in/confirmation. But your agent still can do whatever you allow it to!
- Only supports composer-based Kirby projects (Kirby CLI is used for many capabilities).

## Security model

- `kirby_run_cli_command` is guarded by an allowlist; extend it via `.kirby-mcp/mcp.json` (`cli.allow`, `cli.allowWrite`) and block via `cli.deny`.
- Write-capable actions require explicit opt-in (e.g. `allowWrite=true` or `confirm=true`, depending on the tool).
- `kirby_eval` is disabled by default; enable via `KIRBY_MCP_ENABLE_EVAL=1` or `.kirby-mcp/mcp.json` (`{"eval":{"enabled":true}}`) and still requires per-call confirmation (`confirm=true` or client-side elicitation).
- `kirby_query_dot` is enabled by default; disable via `.kirby-mcp/mcp.json` (`{"query":{"enabled":false}}`) and still requires per-call confirmation (`confirm=true` or client-side elicitation).
- HTTP transport is disabled by default and must never be exposed without Bearer-token authorization.
- HTTP shared-token auth is limited to local development. Keep the token outside source control; the Kirby route rejects shared-token requests when `REMOTE_ADDR` is not loopback or the request host is not a real loopback host.
- HTTP remote-token auth is explicit public bearer-token auth for header-capable clients. Store hashes in config, keep raw tokens in environment/secret storage, require HTTPS for non-loopback route requests, and scope tokens tightly.
- OAuth remains the preferred production path for clients that need an interactive auth flow, including Claude Desktop and Claude.ai custom connectors. The optional built-in provider is disabled by default and writes only to `.kirby-mcp/oauth`.
- HTTP validates `Origin` before MCP protocol handling and rejects missing, malformed, expired, invalid, or insufficient-scope tokens before tool/resource side effects.
- HTTP exposes only the configured MCP route path, `/mcp` by default, for MCP traffic.

## What `install` / `update` change in your project

`vendor/bin/kirby-mcp install`:

- Creates `.kirby-mcp/mcp.json` if neither `.kirby-mcp/mcp.json` nor `.kirby-mcp/config.json` exist.
- Copies runtime command wrappers into the project’s Kirby commands root (usually `site/commands/mcp/`).
- Use `--force` to overwrite existing wrapper files.

`vendor/bin/kirby-mcp update`:

- Overwrites the runtime wrappers (use after upgrading this package).
- Creates `.kirby-mcp/mcp.json` only if missing; it won’t overwrite an existing config.

To remove everything:

- Delete the runtime wrappers folder (`site/commands/mcp/` in most projects).
- Optionally delete `.kirby-mcp/` (config + caches + optional helper files).

## Debug dumps (`mcp_dump`)

This package provides a lightweight `mcp_dump()` helper that appends JSONL to `.kirby-mcp/dumps.jsonl` in the project root.

**Secret redaction:** By default, dump output is scanned for sensitive data (API keys, tokens, passwords, IPs) and redacted before writing. This protects against accidentally leaking secrets. Configure via `dumps.secretPatterns` in `.kirby-mcp/mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "dumps": {
    "secretPatterns": []
  }
}
```

- Omit `secretPatterns` → use built-in patterns (OpenAI/Anthropic/GitHub/Stripe/AWS keys, JWTs, Bearer tokens, IPs, etc.)
- Set to `[]` → disable redaction entirely
- Set to `["/pattern1/", "/pattern2/"]` → use only your custom regex patterns

Typical workflow for your coding agent:

- Add `mcp_dump($anything)` (optionally chain `->green()`, `->label('...')`, `->caller()`, `->trace()`, `->pass($value)`) anywhere in templates/snippets/controllers.
- Call `kirby_render_page` (it returns a `traceId`).
- Call `kirby_dump_log_tail(traceId=...)` to retrieve the captured dump events for that render.

## Configuration

Project config lives in `.kirby-mcp/mcp.json` (or `.kirby-mcp/config.json`) in the Kirby project root.
It is created by `vendor/bin/kirby-mcp install` if missing.

Kirby host selection:

- By default, Kirby CLI runs with no `KIRBY_HOST` override.
- To use host-specific Kirby config, set `KIRBY_MCP_HOST` (or `KIRBY_HOST`) when starting the MCP server, or set `kirby.host` in `.kirby-mcp/mcp.json`:
  - `{"kirby":{"host":"localhost"}}`

## Troubleshooting

- “Unable to determine Kirby project root”: run from the Kirby project root or pass `--project=/absolute/path` (or set `KIRBY_MCP_PROJECT_ROOT`).
- Runtime-only tools fail: run `vendor/bin/kirby-mcp install` and check `kirby_runtime_status`.
- CLI command blocked: add patterns to `.kirby-mcp/mcp.json` (`cli.allow` / `cli.allowWrite`) or block with `cli.deny`.
- Runtime CLI commands fail behind PHP-FPM with exit code 126: set `KIRBY_MCP_PHP_BINARY` to the PHP CLI binary path, e.g. `/opt/php-x.x/bin/php`.
- Host-specific config not applied: set `KIRBY_MCP_HOST`/`KIRBY_HOST` or configure `{"kirby":{"host":"..."}}`.
- Docs resources are slow/failing: confirm network access or adjust `docs.ttlSeconds` (set to `0` to disable caching).
- No dump output: ensure `dumps.enabled=true`, a `.kirby-mcp/dumps.jsonl` exists, and use the correct `traceId` with `kirby_dump_log_tail`.
- HTTP client gets 401/403: confirm Bearer auth, token audience/resource, scopes, and `Origin` match the configured HTTP settings.
- Claude custom connector cannot connect: confirm the public URL is the MCP endpoint (`https://example.com/mcp`), the route helper is registered, `http.enabled=true`, `http.auth.mode=oauth`, `http.oauthProvider.enabled=true`, and non-loopback requests reach Kirby over HTTPS.
