# Scenario: Plugin workflow (local testing + fixtures)

## Goal

Set up a productive plugin development workflow that supports:

- local testing against a Kirby installation
- running plugin tests in isolation
- keeping fixtures/content manageable

## Inputs to ask for

- Where the plugin lives (inside a Kirby project vs separate repo)
- Whether to use a shared Kirby test site with plugins as submodules
- Whether tests exist (phpunit/pest)
- Whether Panel assets need building

## Internal tools/resources to use

- Determine available test commands: `kirby://composer`
- Inspect project structure: `kirby://roots`

## Implementation steps

1. Ensure the plugin can boot in a minimal Kirby instance (test bootstrap).
2. Point test roots to plugin fixtures (e.g. `tests/kirby/content`, `tests/kirby/blueprints`).
3. Keep fixtures small and deterministic.
4. Automate with composer scripts where possible.

## Examples

- Keep a `tests/bootstrap.php` that boots Kirby with minimal roots/fixtures.
- Run tests via `composer test` (prefer repo-local scripts).
- Bootstrap snippet:

```php
<?php
require_once __DIR__ . '/../../../../kirby/bootstrap.php';

new Kirby([
  'roots' => [
    'content'    => __DIR__ . '/kirby/content',
    'blueprints' => __DIR__ . '/kirby/blueprints',
  ],
]);
```

## Verification

- Run the plugin test suite locally.
- Boot a minimal Kirby instance with the plugin enabled.
