# Scenario: Frontend file uploads (template + controller + file blueprint)

## Goal

Allow users to upload files from the frontend safely and attach metadata via a file blueprint.

## Inputs to ask for

- Upload destination page (fixed page like `storage` vs current page)
- Allowed file types and maximum size
- Maximum number of uploads per submit
- Whether uploads should be public, moderated, or quarantined

## Internal tools/resources to use

- Confirm roots: `kirby://roots` (or `kirby_roots`)
- Inspect file blueprints: `kirby_blueprints_index` + `kirby://blueprint/{encodedId}`
- Validate upload page rendering: `kirby_render_page`

## Implementation steps

1. Create a file blueprint used for uploaded files:
   - `site/blueprints/files/upload.yml`
   - define `accept` rules (mime/extension/maxsize) to enforce limits server-side
2. Create a template with:
   - `<form enctype="multipart/form-data">`
   - a honeypot field
3. Create a controller that:
   - validates file count/type/size
   - rejects duplicates or adds a unique prefix to filenames
   - stores uploads with `$page->createFile([...])` (after authentication/impersonation if required)
   - returns success/errors to the template

## Examples (cookbook pattern; abridged)

### Store uploads on a dedicated “storage” page

```php
$uploads = $kirby->request()->files()->get('file');
$kirby->impersonate('kirby');

foreach ($uploads as $upload) {
  page('storage')->createFile([
    'source'   => $upload['tmp_name'],
    'filename' => crc32($upload['name'] . microtime()) . '_' . $upload['name'],
    'template' => 'upload',
  ]);
}
```

## Verification

- Upload allowed files and confirm they are created under the destination page (e.g. `storage`).
- Confirm the file blueprint/template is applied and validation rules are enforced.
